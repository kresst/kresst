# Contributing

New contributions to the library are welcome, but we ask that you please follow these guidelines:

- Use tabs for indentation, not spaces.
- Only change the individual files in `/src`.
- Check that your code will pass `linting` code standards, `yarn lint` will run this for you.
- Check that your code will pass tests, `yarn test` will run tests for you.
- Keep pull requests concise, and document new functionality in the relevant `.md` file.
- Consider whether your changes are useful for all users.
- Avoid breaking changes unless there is an upcoming major release, which are infrequent. We encourage people to care a lot about backwards compatibility.
